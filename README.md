#### Data-Wrangling-with-Baltimore-City-911-Report-Data 
You were just hired as a data analyst for a non-profit organization in Baltimore called “Safe Neighbourhood” which uses data-driven insights to support initiatives to improve public safety. On the first day of your job, you attend a meeting with Chief Safety Officer Gary who is a retired police officer. He brings your attention to an interesting publicly available dataset curating the 911 call reports of the last decade. He asks whether you could help him to turn those data into useful insights to (1) help the police department decide on where and when to deploy resources; (2) provide safety advisory to residents/visitors on the likelihood of crime and types of crime at given time and given location. As the first step to solving this problem, you decide to do an exploratory data analysis to identify interesting patterns to discuss with Gary in the next meeting.
